////// INFO ON HOW TO USE THE RHICCA DATA MERGING SCRIPT ///////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Hi! This is an R script created for the RHICCA project

The code reads in spreadsheets of data from Luminex assay analysis and merges them into one spreadsheet for each timepoint in the longitudinal study.


Successful reading of data necessitates the following: 

-that the spreadsheets are stored as .csv files
-that all spreadsheets make reference somewhere in their file name or directory to their plate number (case insensitive)
-that data from each timepoint is stored in a folder titled as such, which is stored in a folder titled "RHICCA" (the variable "mydir" in the setup chunk requires this, as does
 the variable "time" in the merge chunk, which sets the timepoint for the data to the sub-directory directly inside of the RHICCA folder
 -a path to a .txt file containing a list of sample IDs (separated by spaces) which are incertain or potentially invalid
 
 
 Before reading in data:
 
 Apart from making sure the necessary packages are installed, the variables "mydir" and "uncertain" within the "setup" chunk should be set to the locations of the RHICCA folder and the 
 list of uncertain sample IDs, respectively. No other changes to the code should be necessary.
 
 
 The output will be in the form of a .csv file saved to the working directory, and, if the .Rmd is run, an HTML file detailing steps taken by the code to process the data as well as 
 potential issues with the spreadsheets. 
 
 If you are having issues running the code or have any other questions don't hesitate to contact me at swarthout.olivia@gmail.com!
 Good luck!
